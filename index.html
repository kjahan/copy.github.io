<h1>Statement of Purpose Generator</h1>
<p>For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated by the power of computing and its application in our lives. From my early days in Hong Kong University, where I earned a Bachelor degree in Computer Science, to my later studies at the University of Victoria, where I obtained a Master\u2019s degree in the same field, I have been continuously exploring the possibilities of technology. Of all the topics of study, Machine Learning and Image Recognition have been of particular interest to me.</p>
<p>My fascination with these topics has compelled me to pursue a career as a software engineer at Broadcom Inc., where I have worked for the past thirteen years. Working at Broadcom has enabled me to gain a better understanding of the inner workings of computer networks and the advancements made in the field of Machine Learning.</p>
<p>Now, I am eager to further my knowledge and expertise in the field of Computer Science and thought that the Graduate Program at Stanford University would be the perfect place to do so. At Stanford, I believe I will have the resources and guidance to pursue my research interests, and the opportunity to learn from the best in the field. It would be a great honor for me to be part of such a prestigious institution and I am confident that I can make a valuable contribution to the program.</p>
<p>I am very excited at the prospect of joining the Graduate Program at Stanford University and would be grateful for the opportunity to continue my studies and research in a stimulating and supportive environment.</p>
